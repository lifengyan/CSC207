PHASE 2 MARKING

Phase 2 marks are based on the group presentations (including code and
design quality and project completeness) and your group's unit test
coverage.  Because we did not give you Checkstyle feedback from Phase
1 on time, we have excluded that from the marking.

There is an individual component as well.  Your individual mark was
affected by how well you were able to answer the individual questions.

Before asking for more information about the marking, please re-read
the entire phase 2 handout that is in your group repository, and in
particular everything from "What to do for Phase 2" to the end of the
handout.

Here is the feedback from the TAs:

Your design is solid.  Ther eare some significant issues, such as your 90-line
main method.  In general, you should not have any logic in your main method,
because it prevent testability.

Your documentation was generally good, although there were several methods
that were not commented.  Your naming did not always follow the naming
conventions; for example, you capitalized SequencerScan.

You have hardcoded values.  You need to get used to introducing constants for
sizes of things.  Even better would be to read that information from a config
file.

We opened each project in Eclipse and ran EclEmma.  Here is how we applied the
code coverage deduction:

coverage  deduction
90+       -0
80-89     -2
70-79     -5
60-69     -8
50-59    -11
40-49    -14
20-39    -17
0-20     -20
